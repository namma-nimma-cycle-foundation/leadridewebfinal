“Lead Bengaluru  Ride 2022” is a unique event, a premiere gathering of Business Leaders from Bengaluru and Germany from diverse sectors who are going to ride the cycle on the eve of World Cycle Day, June 3 - Riding for more inclusive, livable and humane streets for Bengaluru.
Over the last twelve years, Namma Nimma Cycle has fueled the cycle  movement to enable “More People Cycle and More Often “ leading to transformation of people and corporate culture.
On June 3 World Cycle Day we are organizing a special event in Association with the Government of Germany and Karnataka Government. Our Partner Enpact has mobilized around 20 Thought Leaders from Germany (CEOs/VCs/CTOs) - who are working in the space of Active and Sustainable Mobility.

As a Cyclist - 

  What motivates us to invite you to be the Champion of Cycling for Bengaluru - is that you are a cyclist yourself and you have been 
  part of cycling in Bengaluru and understand the challenges of cycling and active mobility yourself. And this is an effort by us to connect the cycling ecosystem in India to Germany.
  Your presence will not only add value but will help us scale cycling quickly and bring in alignment/ traction both in the Government and Private Sector across India.  Your peddling will inspire other CEOs to embrace active lifestyle and active mobility.

2. As a Leader  :


Active Mobility is not a priority focus area in the Indian Corporate Sector and through this initiative we want to enable Active Mobility as a critical factor for Employee Wellness and also Commute by building capability and capacity for “Active Mobility Design Thinking” in the Corporate sector.

We are requesting you to join a small (around 25-40) gathering of industry leaders from Germany and India for a round panel discussion on cycling and active mobility to enhance wellness and accelerate cycling in Bengaluru.
