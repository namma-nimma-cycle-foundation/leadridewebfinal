### How Jackie Chan is inspiring Cycling
Jackie Chan, the legendary Hong Kong actor, director, and martial artist, has been an inspiration to many in the entertainment industry for decades. However, his impact goes beyond just the world of film and TV. He has also been a source of inspiration for cycling enthusiasts around the world, as he has been a vocal advocate for the sport and has taken some impressive actions to support it.


Jackie Chan continues to inspire me in my work and see him as one of the leaders working toward active lifestyle and wellness - 
Cycling has always been an underdog in the Asian Cities, with a relatively small focus on Cycling  . To make cycling happen, advocates for cycling have had to use all the tools at their disposal  - inspiring actions. Jackie Chan has played a key role in this effort, and his influence has been felt in many ways.

Jackie Chan has also set an example for others by incorporating cycling into his own life. He has been spotted cycling around his hometown of Hong Kong on several occasions, and he even used a bike to get to the set of one of his movies, rather than relying on a car or other means of transportation. Jackie Chan's influence on cycling is a great reminder that even an underdog sport can find success if it has strong advocates and supporters.

I remember this movie where he fights on a bicycle - it is an action and comedy scene combined together - 
As i watched this Action I can directly connect to the action we might have to do to promote active mobility in India -

### Cycling in multiple  frames - car in a single frame 

Let us watch this action scene that explains the unique versatlity of jackie chan - we figure out that Jackie is the underdog in all his movies.
Modern society treats the cyclists as the underdog always having to negotiate at every turn and every street for his safety and 
people proclaim cycling is dangerous - now who made cycling dangerous ? the cyclists or the car drivers ?

If we look at cycling in multiple frames - it can improve health - enable green commute and also enable community living - 
1. Car Centered society destroys the possibility of health-wellness and agility - 
1. As cyclists "We start beneath his opponents and each action he has to move to the top - "
1. Because he is the underdog - Jackie has to get creative.
1. Jackie like clarity 
2. Jackie gets hurt and we are not invincible 

So as we get more people on cycling - these are the lessons I remember and keep moving and keep pedalling 
Let us be more creative and bring action comedy and fight to make our earth healthy and happy and also lots of fun with cycles
