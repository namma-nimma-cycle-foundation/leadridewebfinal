”In God we trust. All others must bring data.” This quote, made by W. Edwards Deming, highlights the  importance of data measurement .
Do we have the measurement of the growth in the cycling industry due to the efforts of the multiple community stake holders 
and if they are succesful how can they be enabled to pursue with more support .

This article covers the need of the Active Mobility Data  to  show where we sit in that mobility landscape today.
NNCF aspires to bring in visibility and transparency into AM Data Analytics and enable data based decision making in cities to cfreate infrastructure for cyclists and walkers.

## Part I: DULT Mobility Indicators

### Efforts of understanding the availability of Infra for AM

The report 
<a href="https://dult.karnataka.gov.in/uploads/media_to_upload1632382241.pdf"> Mobility Indicator Report </a> This report was prepared under the leadership of DR HS Sudhira who after his Phd joined the DULT as Transport Planner as an Employee. He was responsible for getting the 
Mobility Indicator Data to understand how the travel and traffic is being affected.

Cycling Index refers to the availability of separate cycle tracks or lanes
in the city. In, Bangalore so far there are no cycle tracks. 


Cycle Index = % cycle lanes/total road length
Since there are no separate cycle tracks or lanes in Bangalore the Cycle
Index is zero (0).

Probably this was the first time in the history of the city some one mentioned that the Cycle Index was Zero - that is a city which was growing fast - but in the wrong direction. The policy makers failed to arrive at the plan for enabling cycling .

Data Open city Mobility Indicator Report 
</a>

Open data city also does the study on the mobility indicators. As their web site says 
"Open City is a civic tech project that helps public data on cities be available, discoverable, easily accessible, shareable, understandable, and analysable. Open City levels the playing field for planners, policy makers as well as the public by making public domain data accessible to all in a transparent and free manner.

Our goal is to enable citizens and civic groups to have a shared understanding of their city’s issues, and use data as a basis for co-creating solutions."

Organizes like Oorvani foundation are doing tremendous job in enabling such research - but there are hardly people to work on the data set - 
India needs to train people in data reading and data analysis - Data is the new oil .

### Cycling  and its growing community

Cycling as seen a huge surge post covid - comfort and safety is  what motivates cyclists every day.
 This
is why we are focused on building a strong community of cyclists  who can
participate and improve the " DATA AVAILABILITY " through our open source distribution model.
Let us generate accurate data about the cyclists and cycles for our city as a open source tool.
