Was honored to be invited by Decathlon Leadership for sharing insights into promoting cycling. Decathlon has recently unveiled a new strategy “play” to enable people to play and immerse in sports and promote cycling culture in India. We will be collaborating closely to encourage and popularize the sport of cycling in the country. The focus will be on promoting cycling as a healthy and sustainable way of transportation, as well as encouraging a more active lifestyle .

Decathlon's new strategy is based on the premise that cycling can play a vital role in addressing some of the pressing issues in India, such as air pollution and traffic congestion. The company believes that by encouraging more people to cycle, it can help reduce the congestion ( bengaluru is worlds second most congested city), resulting in less pollution and less congestion. Additionally, cycling is also an excellent form of exercise and can contribute to improving the health and fitness levels of people in India.

To achieve its goal of reaching the sports for the billion I shared the following insights :

1. Ecosystem Enablement - people inside and outside
1. Designing & Building Inclusive Play Products and Play Spaces →
1. Knowledge & Content for Learning → How to play - rules - experience.
1. Finance Support - buy - build - deploy
1. Immersive Experience - immersion-engagement
1. Jobs and Skills - Competency & Capability
1. Upboarding
1. Girls in Sports
1. Access → Equipment , Spaces and Team
1. Navigating Sports for Wellness - Journey of Sports - Coaching 
 
Decathlon's efforts to promote cycling culture in India are part of a broader strategy to increase the company's presence in the country.  

Decathlon's new strategy to promote cycling culture in India is a step in the right direction towards creating a more active, healthy, and sustainable society. By collaborating with Namma Cycle , the company hopes to create a cycling ecosystem that encourages people to take up the sport and make it a preferred mode of transportation. With the right support and infrastructure, cycling can become a way of life in India, and Decathlon is determined to lead the way in making that happen.
