# Lead Ride Guides

We are proposing a Architecture for Social Impact - many of the social projects need to work with many players to derive success.
We have modelled "Lead Ride" as a Enterprise that shall enable the transformation of the Active Mobility.
This model is inspired by the [Enterprise Stack Design](https://enterprisedesign.io/enterprise-design/stack/) 

"Introduce a shared language to discuss challenges in enterprise environments and ecosystems driven by complexity. 
Apply a system of lenses, explore key aspects to consider and prioritize.
Introduce a map to navigate and translate between viewpoints."

We plan to create a structure for this program so that we can succeed globally.
