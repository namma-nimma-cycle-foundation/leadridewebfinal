## Getting Authentication Token

The **Add Participant** API call returns your authentication token. See
[Add a participant](https://docs.dyte.io/api#/operations/addParticipant). Room
name is generated when you create a meeting. You can get the room name from the
developer portal or using REST APIs. For more information, see
[Create a meeting](https://docs.dyte.io/api#/operations/createMeeting).

Dyte Livestreaming provides two modes of operations:

1. Livestreaming Independently
2. Livestreaming a Meeting

These modes help you manage various livestream usecases. Letâ€™s understand what
both of these mean:

- **Livestreaming Independently**: If you want to control what you stream and
  how it is distributed, this is the way to go. Individual ingest URLs can be
  created for ingesting a livestream from apps like OBS, ffmpeg, and others, as
  well as playback URLs to play it in your preferred player.

- **Livestreaming a Meeting**: If you want to stream a meeting to a large number
  of people, this is an excellent option. Dyte provides APIs to automatically
  start livestreaming a meeting, as well as an SDK player that allows users to
  watch the livestream in high quality. For example, livestream a meeting for an
  events platform, a virtual workspace to host large events such as hackathons,
  conferences, or even your own metaverse party.
