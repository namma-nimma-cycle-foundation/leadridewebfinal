# Export Chat Dump of a Session

You can programmatically retrieve all chat messages of a Dyte session using
[Chat Replay API](/api/?v=v2#/operations/GetSessionChat).

:::caution Note

Chat Replay API is not enabled by default for your organization.
[Contact Us](https://dyte.io/contact) to enable the Chat Replay API for your
organziation.

:::

Once [Chat Replay API](/api/?v=v2#/operations/GetSessionChat) is enabled, do the
following:

1. Get the `chat_download_url` using
   [Chat Replay API](/api/?v=v2#/operations/GetSessionChat).
2. Download the chat dump CSV file.

## Get `chat_download_url`

To get the `chat_download_url`, make a `HTTP GET` request to
[Chat Replay API](/api/?v=v2#/operations/GetSessionChat). The API returns the
following:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "chat_download_url": "string",
    "chat_download_url_expiry": "string"
  }
}
```

- `chat_download_url` is the AWS S3 signed URL to download the whole chat dump
  of a session in a CSV format.
- `chat_download_url_expiry` timestamp indicates when the `chat_download_url`
  will expire. If a `chat_download_url` is expired, just call this endpoint
  again to generate a new download URL.

## Download the chat dump file

You can download the chat dump file in CSV format by making `HTTP GET` request
to `chat_download_url` that you obtained in the previous step.

The process of downloading any file from a HTTP URL in JavaScript differs
slightly based on whether you are doing it on client side or server side.

### Download on the client

To download at client side, do the following:

1. Make a GET request to the `chat_download_url`.
2. Convert response to blob.
3. Create an invisible `<a>` HTML element with download attribute and add the
   above blob to it's `href`.
4. Programatically click on the `<a>` element so that the browser automatically
   starts downloading and then remove the `<a>` element.

### Download on the server

We use `Node.js` streams to download files on the server, so the steps are as
follows:

1. Create a writable stream for a local file.
2. Make a GET request to `chat_download_url`.
3. Get a readable stream using `res.body` and pipe to the writable stream
   created in the first step.

## Example: CSV chat dump File

This CSV file contains all the chat messages along with the participant's name
and some other metadata. It contains the following column headers:

- `id`: This is the chat message ID unique to each chat message.
- `participantId`: This is the ID of the participant that sent this message.
- `sessionId`: The ID of the session in which this chat message was sent. This
  will be the same as what you sent as URL param in the above endpoint.
- `meetingId`: The id of the meeting to which this session belongs to.
- `displayName`: Display name of the participant who sent this message.
- `pinned`: A boolean that indicates if the current message was pinned or not.
- `isEdited`: A boolean that indicates if the current message was edited or not.
- `payloadType`: An ENUM that indicates the type of payload sent in the chat
  message. It can be one of TEXT_MESSAGE, IMAGE_MESSAGE, FILE_MESSAGE.
- `payload`: The actual payload sent in this chat message.
- `createdAt`: Timestamp when this chat message was sent
