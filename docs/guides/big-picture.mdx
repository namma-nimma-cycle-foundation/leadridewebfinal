## What is Lead Ride ?

Lead ride is a communities-centric movement designed to empower citizens to
transform cities and places into active mobility spaces. the movement supports
citizens and leaders to relaim spaces and reimagine mobility.

The values of [beingness](https://) (the state of being), cycling (the state of
pedalling and moving), and togetherness (the state of being together) and
leading (the state of guiding towards a better future) form the three core axes
of Lead Ride and of our own motivations for this work.

"Lead ride moves people to cycle together and reimagine spaces"

1. ⚡️CONNECTING PEOPLE & CYCLING by cycling together ⚡️
1. ⚡️MAKING PEOPLE ACTIVE by cycling together⚡️
1. ⚡️MAKING PEOPLE INVOLVE WITHIN AND WITH COMMUNITY by cycling together⚡️
   Lead bring new actors, new ideas, and new power together to drive
   transformational change in cities.

We believe that "Lead Ride " can become a driver for Active Lifestyke and
Wellbeing in every city, every campus and every company. To achieve this, we are
connecting key stakeholders, helping companies, institutions understand the
value of Active MObility.

## Architecture

How does Lead Ride Enterprise work and function, and how do its many structures
support these activities? Lead Ride as a program that is purposefully designed
system of control structures, managing resources, assets, process flows, and

### Immersive Experience - Lead Ride

By enabling togetherness while cycling we intend to create an immersive
experience which will eventually - help -

1. Reimagining mobility to reduce traffic fatigue;
1. Building collective intelligence and acumen across companies , institutions
   and cities;
1. Creating more agile operating active mobility models and designs with clear
   execution paths.
1. Deepening human connections between government, companies, and citizens.

### Lead Ride Active Mobility Hub:

Lead Ride hub to enable the team to work and collaborate for activating walking
and cycling.

Establish a home for Active Mobility online, a new digital hub under a
governance structure that can ensure the growth of a diverse global community
with a plethora of contributions and projects from many organizations.
Governance should be federated, rather than one-size-fits-all. LeadRide.bike -
will eventually have a platform - hub.leadride.bike where all the Active
Mobility Solutions converge and discuss and we are looking for tech partners to
build this ecosystem.

## Lead Ride Studio

The Lead Ride Learning + Collaboration Studio designs tools and methods for more
engaging, more equitable, online learning and collaboration experiences. The
studio coordinates the Lead Ride's activities in three areas:

Professional learning and practice: Develop Active Mobility tools & solutions,
patterns, anti-patterns platforms, online courses, and other remote
collaboration opportunities for companies, institutions and cities.

Education: Integrate Active mobility in student life with focus on
cycling/walking with the way our graduate students learn and collaborate by
working closely with our academicians ().

Outreach: Broaden the Lead ride’s impact by openly sharing our ideas and
research, and by co-designing new solutions together with communities around the
world.

Leadership and governance involves ensuring strategic policy frameworks exist
and are combined with effective oversight, coalition-building, regulation,
attention to system-design and accountability.

Four main categories of stakeholders who interact with each other determine the
active mobility system and its governance:  
the State (government organizations and agencies at central and sub-national
level);

### System Block

Lead Ride tries to integrate three critical sectors for effective
transformation:

1. The City Leadership - urban design and planning and execution service
   providers & the transport providers in the city
1. The Corporate Sector - companies which drive the economy
1. The University System - students and citizens of the future.

These blocks which are working in silos come together to manage various active
mobility livestream usecases. Let’s understand what both of these mean:

- **The City Leadership**: The city leadership envisions active mobility as a
  real driver for wellbeing of the citizens. It commits funding and builds a
  enabling path and a milestone for achieving status of a cycling and walkable
  city. 10+ years

- **The Corporate Sector **: Since the Corporate Sector has to deal with bad
  planning which affects the productivity of the employees, it drives the change
  from within and also in its neighborhoods. Leaders commit to employee wellness
  and employee productivity - explore path ways for active mobility enablement.

- **The University System**: The students need to be aware of the choices
  available and habits for wellness

### Envisioned Future Due to Lead Ride

In the future we envision a system for enabling active mobility at each city
with focus on citizen consultation for their needs and expectations.

- Situation analysis of the active mobility sector
- Priority-setting for active mobility policies, strategies and plans
- Strategic planning: transforming priorities into plans
- Operational planning: transforming plans into action
- Estimating cost implications of a active mobility policy, strategy or plan
- Budgeting for active mobility
- Monitoring, evaluation and review of active mobility policies, strategies and
  plans
- Safety, Law, regulation and strategizing for active mobility ‎
- Intersectoral planning for active mobility and mobility

Lead Ride Framework for changing the Living Environment of Urban Areas

## Experience

What do people get out of Lead Ride , and what role does Lead Ride want to play
in their daily lives? This aspect is about the lead Ride as a space of people,
environments, and artifacts. A vision for better, faster, more pervasive Active
Mobility Culture

Three worlds coming together

Public health - mobility and urban planning - we have developed the design
principles for active mobility success.

Bicycle communities have revolutionized the development and adoption of Active
Mobility .Community Participatioin and Community Involvement is the way for
human centered approach. It’s also a key driver of new cities where Active
Mobility has transformed the way of living.

To fuel this community effort, an entire world of tools, data sets, and
platforms for open development has to be created. Lead Ride will develop a
platform for people to come tigether and commit for active lifestyle.

City building is a community endeavor as well: While Citis in India have made an
attempt to build cycle infrastructure, the resulting outcomes has too often been
fragmented, specific, closed, and driven by immediate needs. We have not
progressed beyond Demonstration or Pilot Projects.'
